# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-16)

**Core value:** Help PLN NP select the best pilot unit for MECH WIZ and explain the early feasibility case visually, quantitatively, and in an investor-friendly way without inventing unsupported numbers.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — Scenario Simulation Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Scenario Simulation Engine) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3 complete
Status: Executing Phase 02; ready for plan 02-02
Last activity: 2026-05-16 -- Scenario and financial assumption management implemented

Progress: [###-------] 27%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: n/a

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. MVP Spine & Unit Data | 3/3 | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Scenario Simulation Engine | 1/3 | n/a | n/a |
| 3. Strategy Dashboard & Ranking | 0/3 | n/a | n/a |
| 4. Investor Case & Data Quality | 0/3 | n/a | n/a |
| 5. LLM & Document Intelligence | 0/3 | n/a | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 02-01
- Trend: Phase 2 execution started with scenario management slice complete

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Use default GSD settings with YOLO mode, coarse granularity, parallel execution, committed planning docs, balanced agents, and workflow research/plan-check/verifier enabled.
- Initialization: Skip project-level research and use the provided MECH WIZ blueprint as the source of truth.
- Initialization: Use Vertical MVP roadmap structure.
- Initialization: Preserve deterministic backend calculations as numeric source of truth; use LLM only for narratives and document support.
- Addendum import: Treat `docs/MECH_WIZ_Heatmap_Map_Addendum.md` as the source for the Map & Heatmap Intelligence Layer.
- Addendum import: Use MapLibre GL JS for Phase 3 map rendering unless technically blocked.
- Addendum import: Use opportunity, readiness, and confidence scores as separate visible scores; composite score is 45/35/20 and heatmap weight includes economic return.
- Addendum import: Keep Phase 1 `plants` table for v1 and adapt addendum `plant_sites` / `plant_units` concepts during Phase 3 planning rather than rewriting shipped Phase 1 schema.
- Phase 02-01: Business scenarios remain tied directly to Phase 1 `plants`; one financial assumption record is upserted per scenario.
- Phase 02-01: CAPEX fields remain nullable and assumption records carry `data_status` plus `confidence_level`.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Workspace `.git` is a read-only empty tmpfs mount, so normal `git status` fails. GSD commits are written using separate gitdir `.git-real` with `GIT_DIR=.git-real GIT_WORK_TREE=.`.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Pre-FEED | Detailed CAPEX/OPEX, vendor proposal comparison, offtake readiness, MRV, detailed risk register | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Operational Digital Twin | DCS/SCADA, real-time optimization, predictive maintenance, live MRV, production optimization | Deferred to v3 | Initialization |
